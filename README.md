# AI Agent on Fleek with CDP

This repository demonstrates the usage of Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) Agentkit and related tools to build autonomous blockchain agents. These agents can interact with on-chain environments, perform blockchain-specific tasks, and respond intelligently to user requests. The project showcases integrations with LangChain, a powerful AI framework, to enable seamless natural language interactions.

## Features
- Blockchain Agent: Interact with on-chain environments using CDP's tools.
- Autonomous Mode: Run the agent autonomously with periodic blockchain interactions.
- Customizable Configuration: Modify LLM (Large Language Model) configurations, network settings, and tools.
- Simulated Blockchain Actions: Demonstrate balance checking, transactions, and other common blockchain tasks.
- Memory Persistence: Store conversation history for continuity across interactions.
